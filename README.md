In this project, we are interested in modelling the positivity rate of COVID in higher education institutions in the U.S. Based on our Bayesian hierarchical Beta-Binomial and regression models, we found that Carleton in 2021 has done a better job controlling the spread of COVID on campus compared with 2020, when the majority of students first began to return. The level of COVID threats in the surrounding area, particularly Rice county, is a significant predictor associated with changes in the number of COVID cases within Carleton, whereas temperature is less relevant in explaining any rise or fall of positive cases on campus. Our findings further suggest that for all higher education institutions, the institution's total enrollment, test rate (number of tests administrated divided by the enrollment) and type of the institution (either being a liberal arts college or a university) are significant predictors affecting the positive rates of COVID testing. A larger student body, less frequent testing and being a university can all be associated with higher COVID positive rates on campus.
